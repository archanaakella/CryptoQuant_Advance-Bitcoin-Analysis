# Crypto Trade Classification - Identifying Good & Bad Trades

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and making the right trading decisions is crucial for maximizing profits. This project aims to develop a machine learning classification model that labels trades as "Good" or "Bad" based on historical data, market trends, and sentiment analysis.

# ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

Traders often struggle to distinguish profitable (Good) trades from unprofitable (Bad) ones. The goal of this project is to:

Detect patterns in crypto price movements.

Identify key factors influencing trade outcomes.

Build a predictive model that classifies trades effectively.

# ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting raw Bitcoin data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing price movements, volume trends, and volatility.

Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful indicators such as moving averages and volatility bands.

Trade Classification: Building an ML model to predict whether a trade is "Good" or "Bad."

Advanced Visualizations: Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for intuitive charts.

# ðŸ“‚ Approach
Data Loading & Cleaning: Remove missing values, convert data types, and standardize the dataset.

EDA & Visualization: Identify key insights from price trends, distributions, and correlations.

Feature Engineering: Generate custom indicators for better model performance.

ML Model Training: Use classification algorithms to predict trade outcomes.

Performance Evaluation: Assess the model using confusion matrices and accuracy scores.
